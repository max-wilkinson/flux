# Flux

Flux is a flexible timer for establishing your working rhythm.

## Background

Psychology defines _flow_ as the mental state in which you are fully immersed in an activity. This is sometimes referred to as being "in the zone." Managing your flow is an important part of optimizing your productivity.

Over the years, three different work rhythms have emerged in pursuit of managing flow: Pomodoro, Desktime, and Ultradian.

1. Pomodoro utilizes 25 minutes of work with a 5 minute break.
2. Desktime utilizes 52 minutes of work with a 17 minutes break.
3. Ultradian utilizes 90 minutes of work with an extended break.

This extension provides a timer that can be configured to operate at any of these rhythms.

> Tip: This [blog post](https://medium.com/@timmetz/pomodoro-technique-and-other-work-rhythms-which-one-suits-you-34c2d05fe46e) provides a great overview of these work rhythms.

## Getting Started

## Features
